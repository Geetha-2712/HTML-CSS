<p>Three-phase Multiport Inverter For Interfacing Photovoltaic And Energy Storage Systems To The Electric Grid</p>
<p>A Three-Phase Multiport Inverter integrates photovoltaic (PV) systems and energy storage with the electric grid using a single unit. It enables efficient power flow, grid support, and energy management by combining MPPT, bidirectional charging, and three-phase output. The system was modeled and simulated using MATLAB/Simulink, making it ideal for smart grid and renewable energy applications.</p>
<p>Solar Power Battery Charge Controller
<p>Designed a controller to manage battery charging and discharging in solar systems, preventing overcharging and
deep discharge. This ensures efficient energy storage and a reliable power supply from solar panels.</p>
